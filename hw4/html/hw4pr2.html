%% Homework 4 - Problem 2
% Download the data hw4_2 from the website.  The data is in the form [t y].
%  Supose we want to design an estimator to estimate the bias in the
%  measurement y.  We believe that the bias (x) is constant.

clear; clc; close all;
load hw4_2.txt;
t = hw4_2(:,1); y = hw4_2(:,2);
%plot(t,y);
sigma_v = 1;

%% Part A
% Run the Kalman filter estimator with Q_d = 0.  What happens at t> 100
% seconds.  Why?  Calculate the steady state Kalman gain L_ss.  Plot L(k).
% This is known as the filter "going to sleep."

%%% Answer
% When the system is simulated, the estimated value remains at 1, even
% though there is a step function in the system.  It then slowly decays to
% match the system, but the time constant on the filter is too large.  The
% filter ignores all of the measurements after it has reached it's steady
% state.
%
% The hand calculations reveal that the filter's Pminus should approach
% zero, Pplus should approach zero, so Lss should approach zero as well.
% The plot of Lk vs time indicates that this is the behavior that I saw.

    % Compute Kalman Gain
    P_plus(ii) = P_minus(ii) * (P_minus(ii) + R)^-1;
    L(ii) = P_plus(ii)/inv(R);
    
    % Update estimator with y(k)
    E(ii) = y(ii) - x_hat_minus(ii);
    x_hat_plus(ii) = x_hat_minus(ii) + L(ii) * E(ii);
    
    % Update covariance

    % Propagate Forward

%% Part B
% "Tune" Qd to track the bias.

%%% Answer
% As the values of Q are varied from 0.0001 to 0.01, the estimated value
% x_hat tracks much closer to the measurements.  The filter is no longer
% "going to sleep" like it did in the first problem.
%
% This is not without side effect.  As Q increases, it is likely that the
% estimator is starting to track measurement noise as well as disturbance
% noise, which produces a less valuable output.  Also, the filter never
% approaches the 0 steady state as it did in the first part.  Instead, it
% converges on a higher value.

    title(sprintf('Q = %g',Q));
end

%% Part D
% How does this compare to the Kalman filter solution?  Why are these two
% filters the same for this problem?
%

%%% Answer
% The low pass filter and the Kalman filter have nearly identical responses
% in this problem.
%
% The reason for the similarity is because the Kalman filter is in essence
% an adaptive bandwidth low-pass filter.  The reason that the first order
% LPF works just as well as the Kalman filter is that there are no system
% dynamics to take into account (xdot = 0), and we are just estimating what
% is essentially a constant (plus some disturbance and noise).  In this
% case, the Kalman filter reduces to the low-pass filter, in a way.
